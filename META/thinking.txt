this guy has python code
https://github.com/sboosali/music/blob/master/etc/helloworld.fluidsynth.py

am I more likely to regret writing this in C or in Python?
(forget C++)
(Haskell would be hilarious tho)
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fluidsynth-0.1.0.0
(JS/JQuery would also be entertaining)

previous strategy: C unless and until I'm tired of it, Python next

new plan: try making it out of qsynth in qt
nope qsynth is too big to work from directly

potentially useful: http://vmpk.sourceforge.net/
virtual software keyboard, could be rearrangeable
